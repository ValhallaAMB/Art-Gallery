You (the user) have two options to initiate and use the project:

1) Start the entire project from scratch by establishing the database and its tables (e.g., createDB, createArtist, createEmployee, and createGuest), then add the corresponding data.

2) (The preferred way) Execute the "createDB.php" file through WampServer's localhost and simply import the "art_gallery.sql" into the appropriate phpMyAdmin database. This process will import all of the tables and their information.
